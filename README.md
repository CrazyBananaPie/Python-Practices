# Python Practices Repository

This repository houses a collection of Python programming projects and assignments I completed during my university studies. It consists of two main folders:

1. **Programming-in-Python**: This folder contains a variety of Python programming exercises and assignments. These projects showcase my practical application of Python in solving real-world problems and building useful applications.

2. **Algorithms-and-Data-Structures**: In this folder, you'll find implementations of various algorithms and data structures in Python. These assignments demonstrate my understanding of fundamental computer science concepts and my ability to apply them effectively in Python.

Feel free to explore the contents of this repository to gain insights into my Python programming skills and my grasp of algorithms and data structures. If you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find the contents of this repository informative and useful.
